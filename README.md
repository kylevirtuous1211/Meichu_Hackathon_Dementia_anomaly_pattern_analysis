# Meichu_Hackathon_Dementia_anomaly_pattern_analysis
This project uses a deep learning model (LSTM Autoencoder) to analyze GPS trajectory data and detect anomalies. The primary goal is to identify unusual movement patterns which could potentially be correlated with early signs of dementia.  The model is trained on the large-scale Microsoft GeoLife dataset
